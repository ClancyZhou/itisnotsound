Hello World. I'm <strong>Raffaele Viglianti</strong>, a PhD student in <strong>Digital Humanities at King's College London</strong>. My blog will contain some more or less structured thoughts and experiences from my work at the <a title="Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London" href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh" target="_blank">Department of Digital Humanities</a> and on my <a title="PhD Project" href="http://itisnotsound.wordpress.com/phd-project/">PhD project</a>.

My research focuses mainly on<strong> digital methodologies for musicology</strong>, but my interests lie in the written expression of music; particularly the phenomenology of writing and reading/performing a music score. So, in my posts I'll rarely refer to sound and more often to written notation.

As part of my PhD, I am currently working with the <a title="Weber Gesamtausgabe Website" href="http://www.weber-gesamtausgabe.de/en/Index" target="_blank">WeGA</a> on a digital edition of <strong>Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz</strong>. I will occasionally be posting about oddities that I find in the sources, and how I'm dealing with them using the <a title="Music Encoding Initiative website" href="http://www.music-encoding.org" target="_blank">Music Encoding Initiative</a> and the <a title="Text Encoding Initiative Website" href="http://www.tei-c.org" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative</a> formats.

<strong>This blog will not just be about music</strong>, however. Working as a developer and teacher at the department means that I get involved in Digital Humanities projects that span across several disciplines (I particularly enjoyed working on <a title="Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts Website" href="http://janeausten.ac.uk/index.html" target="_blank">Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts</a> and a few projects involving <a title="Epidoc on Sourceforge" href="http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Epidoc</a>), so I will also post about other <strong>DH topics, methods, technologies, teaching</strong>...

Thanks for reading! And if you were wondering how the score in the image is played, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2qQ6UWbRVc" target="_blank">here's an example</a>.
