Raffaele Viglianti is a research programmer at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu) (MITH).

Raffâ€™s work revolves around digital editions and textual scholarship. He is currently an elected member of the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org) technical council and an advisor for the [Music Encoding Initiative](http://music-encoding.org), which produces guidelines for the digital representation of music notation with a focus on scholarly requirements.

As a researcher, Raff specializes in editions of music scores, contributing to the ongoing change to scholarly editorial theory and practice in the digital medium. His work also focuses on the shaping of music performance practice by the *digital consumption* of music scores, or the performance of a music score from a digital device.
